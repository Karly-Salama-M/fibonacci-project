## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Calculate the fibonacci of any given number
- See previous calculations with dates

In this project we had to create a function that calls a local server that makes fibonacci calculations by using fetch, and go through that data to present to the user: results, list of results and error messages given certain conditions.
